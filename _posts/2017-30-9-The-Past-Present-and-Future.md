So I've started digging back into hacking the older MH titles *(mostly FU)* and decided to touch on a project I started a few years ago but went on a long hiatus due to other interests and IRL dilemmas. However lots has changed since then and so here's basically how things started, how they are now and what's to come in the future.

Past
-------------

Back in 2015 I announced a project to enhance MHFU called... you guessed it... "*Monster Hunter Freedom Unite Enhanced*". The original goal of the project was to:

* Fix "dummied" items to be obtainable and translated properly 
* Expand FU quests to include all the DLC from US and translated JPN quests
* Enhance the original textures 

At the time I didn't have a 3DS so I was looking at this as a fun project... However that didn't last long as I got a 3DS and started playing 4U and eventually got into reversing the game and its quest format. To keep it short basically I ended up continuing this up with each game until around XX where I lost interest in current MH titles and started having a craving to go back to the old MHFU project.

Sadly I didn't really do a whole lot of documentation on what was done in MHFU and any that I *did* document ended up being eaten by a dying hdd so I had to start from scratch.

Present
--------------

Lots has changed since the project has been restarted... For instance, PPSSPP now has a texture replacer meaning you no longer have to expand/rebuild DATA.BIN for texture hacks. Audio has been reversed and certain aspects can be enhanced or changed, though sadly for certain sfx theres not much that can be done. The Quest updates ended up having a "less-than-ideal" solution to a problem which has made it a bit more hackishly implemented than I originally wanted...

Theres still a bit to go through but sadly I didn't document much of my findings which has resulted in me starting from scratch... I'm currently going through and building up documentation that will eventually be put up for others to also look at and maybe also modify the MH games to their liking.

Future
--------------

As of right now IRL has kicked in again and I'm finding it hard to make time to actually work on everything *(hence why I started going through and making clean documentation for others to use)*... So far what I have planned for the mod is:

**Core:**

* UI hacks to scale menus/UI elements for 720p/1080p resolutions better
* Change HH mechanic to mimic that of MHFrontier

**Quests:**

* Expand FU quests to include all the DLC from US and translated JPN quests
* Arena Randomizer

**Visual/Audible:**

* Fix "dummied" items to be obtainable and translated properly 
* Enhance the original textures *(Right now being worked on by ice and sweet.)*
* Enhance various audio files

This isn't a complete list of things I'm looking at changing... But hopefully I'll be able to release the mod in the near futureâ„¢ but for now the primary focus is on documentation...
